# For honours students

You've got R skills (yes you do) and come from a reputable research uni. You are packed with skill. Here are the research opportunities that you can apply for. Don't be afraid to go for them even if they look like a long shot at first sight.

## Carnegie Trust Vacation Scholarship

- This scheme is for undergraduate students in their penultimate year (so third-years here).

- The way it works is you make a research project, find a supervisor, write a proposal and submit an application.

- If accepted, you get a scholarship which includes a weekly stipend which will be the equivalent of the current Scottish Living Wage rate (£12.60 per hour in 2025), and you do your research over the summer!

- The bursary is usually for up to 12 weeks.

<br>

**The deadline for this year is on the 14th of February, 2025!**

**Ask [Sinéad](https://uk.linkedin.com/in/sineadcleary) for experience!**

## Experimental Psychology Society (EPS) Undergraduate Bursary

- This is a psychology specific bursary - it supports undergraduates studying psychology or a related discipline in the summer vacation immediately prior to their final year (so third-years again!).

- The way it works is you make a research project, find a supervisor, write a proposal together with the supervisor (and then the supervisor submits this application).

- If accepted, you get up to 10 weeks’ support (a £375 per week stipend) for your research project.

- Note: the supervisor must be a member of the Experimental Psychology Society.

<br>

**The deadline for this year is on the 1st of March, 2025!**

## BPS Undegraduate Research Assistantship Scheme

- Very similar to EPS - you outline a project, apply with your supervisor, and you have to be a third-year.

- The award provides a student stipend at a weekly rate of £270, for 6 or 8 weeks.

- Your supervisor must have a BPS membership.

<br>


**The deadline for this year is on the 9th of March, 2025!**

**Ask [Jana](https://uk.linkedin.com/in/jana-tomastikova) or [Sinéad](https://uk.linkedin.com/in/sineadcleary) for application experience (we got the award but didn't take it).**


## MRC Cognition and Brain Sciences Unit (CBU) Placement Scheme at Cambridge

- This is a 6-week placement at the CBU at the University of Cambridge for third-years! It slays really hard.

- Essentially, they advertise projects at around March time, you put together an application (no need to write a proposal) where you indicate your motivations, interests, past research experience, widening participation info, and rank your preferred projects.

- If they like your application, you are invited for an interview.

- If successful, you get to spend time in a Cambridge college, and go to the CBU every day to help with a research project under a supervisor (which could be a post-doc or a PhD student).

- You get roughly £2400 for the whole placement (this is just an estimate based on what it was in 2023/24), but you have to pay for your accommodation at the Cambridge college (which could be around ~£1000 for the 6 weeks, but you will still have some money left). They will facilitate the accommodation for you.

<br>

**The deadline for this year is around March or April time, keep a look out, it's not advertised super early.**

## Medical Research Scotland Undergraduate Vacation Scholarship

- This scholarship supports undergraduate students that want to do research relevant to human health or disease. This is for 2nd or 3rd year students.

- You need to contact a supervisor again, develop the project and application together, but the application must be submitted by the supervisor.

- For projects lasting six weeks, each with a student stipend paid at £420 per week.

<br>

**The deadline for this year is 12 noon, 6th of February, 2025.**

## NIHR Undergraduate Student Internship Programme

- This placement encourages students to consider a career in academic primary care by gaining hands-on experience in primary care research.

- You will join an established research team and gain skills in primary care focused research.

- I do not know much about this placement but I do know that there is a website that you can check out [here](https://www.spcr.nihr.ac.uk/career-development/spcr-undergraduate-programme).

- Also, this website is also worth checking out for a general overview of mental health research - [link](https://mentalhealthresearch.org.uk)

<br>

**The deadline for this year is 1pm 25th March, 2025.**

## Our Minds Programme

- Edinburgh Neuroscience funds up to eight 2-month-long projects exploring some aspect of our thinking, past, present or future - this could be a research project or an outreach project or even and artsy project.

- This is more of a diverse/flexible programme which doesn't necessarily have to be research.

- From the website to get an idea of what they are looking for: "The project should be relevant to questions concerning our minds, such as how it works, why we think the way we do, what we think about, and the outcomes this thinking leads to. For example, you might be interested in creating artwork that explores and questions ideas about the mind, or in exploring the phrenologist’s collection in the Anatomical Museum, you could work in a laboratory studying how the brain works or how it can go wrong, or you might want to tell stories about historical or contemporary issues/challenges related to the mind."

- You still need to approach a supervisor before you propose the project.

- You will need to propose how you will engage the public with the outcome of your project.

- You will get a taxable two-month scholarship of £3,500 in total and a contribution of up to £500 for additional expenses.

<br>

**The deadline hasn't been set yet for this year, but from previous years you should expect it to be around April time.**

For more information, although they still need to update it, look [here](https://www.edinburghneuroscience.ed.ac.uk/scholarshipsfunding/scholarship-our-mind-programme).

**Ask [Jana](https://uk.linkedin.com/in/jana-tomastikova) for experience.**


## New:  Science and Policy internship scheme at the MRC CBU

- This is a new internship scheme from 2025 which aims to recruit an undergraduate intern in collaboration with the UK Government Department for Science, Innovation and Technology to tackle questions relating to mental health, developmental trajectories and social media usage.

- This internship is a paid opportunity, with the student receiving ~£2,030/month. 

- The internship will span from 16th of June 2025 to the 5th of September 2025 in-person, and we will support applicants in finding suitable accommodation in Cambridge for that period.

<br>

**The application deadline is the 14th of February.**

## Rank Prize Undergrad Vacation Grant

- Again, you have to be in your third year.

- The supervisor has to apply for this (and they have to be doing research in vision - Jasna? Ed?)

- The value of the grant is £460 per week per student together with up to £500 in total for consumables. The grant covers up to 8 weeks.
