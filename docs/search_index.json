Are you interested and motivated to find research opportunities alongside your psychology degree? Not sure what’s out there or how to make sense of it? We’ve been there too and made this guide for you :) This is a list of opportunities based on PsyCRA enthuisiasts’ research experience during their psychology degrees. We hope that this will be helpful and provide a starting point from which you can find opportunities that are right for you. 1.1 A message of encouragement Research experience will be easier to get as you move up years and be most easily available in 4th year and beyond. No one expects to have done much prior to that, but you definitely can if that interests you! The list below can help you be proactive when your emails go unanswered and you want to strengthen your skills. 1.2 Disclaimer This list is not an exhaustive. If you know of anything that should go on the list, please let us know! 1.3 About PsyCRA The Psychology Community and Research Association was founded in 2021 as a subcomittee of the Edinburgh University Psychology Society. It is a society where you can: learn how to get research experience get advice on postgraduate applications learn about honours courses and dissertations vent with no judgement (because we all get overwhelmed sometimes…) You can follow us on instagram at @psycra.ed. 1.4 People Current committee (2024/2025) Jana Tomastikova Head of PsyCRA Millie Davies Events Coordinator Jennifer Islam Communications Officer Christopher Stordahl Postgraduate Liason Past committee members Sinéad Cleary (Head of PsyCRA 2023/2024, Communications Officer 2022/2023) Mine Gelegen (Communications Officer 2023/2024) Clara Sanchez-Izquierdo Lozano (Head of PsyCRA 2022/2023) Kate Li (Events Coordinator 2022/2023) Naiti Bhatt (Postgraduate Liason 2022/2023) Founders - the OGs - the CEOs (thanks guys) Julie Pedersen (Head of PsyCRA 2021/2022, Postgraduate Liason 2023/2024) Charlotte Sudduth (Events Coordinator 2021/2022) Kayleigh Smith (Communications Officer 2021/2022) "],["for-beginners.html", "Chapter 2 For beginners 2.1 More words of encouragement 2.2 Edinburgh Scientific Researchers Association (ESRA) 2.3 Volunteer Research Assistant (VRA) programme (Rare in pre-honours) 2.4 Student-led, Individually-created Courses (SLICC) 2.5 Emailing", " Chapter 2 For beginners 2.1 More words of encouragement Getting research experience in your first years of undergrad is quite rare - but not impossible! Here are some of the things that you can do to get into research without having ANY experience. 2.2 Edinburgh Scientific Researchers Association (ESRA) About ESRA is a society just like any other but with a special aim to promote independent undergraduate research projects - this is cool. Essentially, here you can come up with a small research project on your own (or in pairs or groups) and lead it from conception to final write up and presentation. ESRA has different ‘departments’ - one of which is the Social Sciences department, which serves as a platform ( a place to meet) for you to brainstorm and develop your experiment with other students interested in social sciences (this is usually Psychology, Linguistics or Philosophy students) The head of the Social Sciences department will help you finalise your idea. Then you can write your proposal (which will get approved by ESRA), submit an ethics form, and then you can go on and collect your data (or do secondary data analysis / or even a lit review) and finally make a poster at the end, which you can present at the ESRA conference at the end of the academic year. All these skills above are exactly the skills you need to develop to be a great researcher - and this is a good place to start. There is no pressure, even no need to actually finish the project. You are the boss of your research. Also also, ESRA will even give you funding to conduct your research, which is great! The skills you develop in ESRA, and the fact that you even participate in a small conference, you can put on your CV or talk about when you are applying for actual research placements or Volunteer Research Assistant (VRA) positions. PsyCRA members corroborate (this is what got us some of the cool opportunities that are further along this document) What you need to do Join ESRA at the start of the semester Go to the Social Sciences department meetings - they usually happen every week Where to find more info ESRA EUSA page ESRA Instagram 2.3 Volunteer Research Assistant (VRA) programme (Rare in pre-honours) About You might get an email from the psychology department about this. The purpose of this programme is to offer undergraduate Psychology students the opportunity to acquire additional research experience in the field, working with an established researcher (somebody in the department). This is a great opportunity to get to know the research that is going on in the department, and also to get to know the researchers here. It’s hard to predict what exactly you will be doing, as it varies depending on what research projects are being conducted. But in general, I would recommend just going with whatever you are assigned to and making the most of it, because you will never know what area might interest you! Priority is given to 3rd and 4th years for this, so it’s best not to have your expectations too high, but there are first or second years that did do this! What you need to do Fill out a survey that the department will send out. There, you will have to tell them some of your grades (it’s advantageous if your grades are good), write a short statement as to why you want to be a volunteer research assistant, and indicate which areas interest you (there is no guarantee you will get something you are specifically interested in, but that’s okay, just go with what you get). You will help with whatever needs to be done for the research project, usually lasting a semester (but you can also agree with your supervisor to continue for longer if it interests you and there is more work to do) Where to find more info The department sends an email :) 2.4 Student-led, Individually-created Courses (SLICC) I don’t known a tonne about this, but I do know the have a website which you can check out and find out more! SLICC 2.5 Emailing It’s okay to email a lecturer and ask if you can help with their research in any way, or ask for advice This is very much a “right place, right time” thing, they might not have any work suitable for you but it never hurts to ask and they will remember your interest! Do not ask post-docs or PhDs directly, you need to go through the lecturer/researcher heading the research they are working on You can also talk to your cohort lead and the career service - set up a meeting!
