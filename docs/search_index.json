Are you interested and motivated to find research opportunities alongside your psychology degree? Not sure what’s out there or how to make sense of it? We’ve been there too and made this guide for you :) This is a list of opportunities based on PsyCRA enthuisiasts’ research experience during their psychology degrees. We hope that this will be helpful and provide a starting point from which you can find opportunities that are right for you. 1.1 A message of encouragement Research experience will be easier to get as you move up years and be most easily available in 4th year and beyond. No one expects to have done much prior to that, but you definitely can if that interests you! The list below can help you be proactive when your emails go unanswered and you want to strengthen your skills. 1.2 Disclaimer This list is not exhaustive. If you know of anything that should go on the list, please let us know! 1.3 About PsyCRA The Psychology Community and Research Association was founded in 2021 as a subcomittee of the Edinburgh University Psychology Society. It is a society where you can: learn how to get research experience get advice on postgraduate applications learn about honours courses and dissertations vent with no judgement (because we all get overwhelmed sometimes…) You can follow us on instagram at @psycra.ed. 1.4 People Current committee (2024/2025) Jana Tomastikova Head of PsyCRA (made this doc - hello!)

Here are some of the things that you can do to get into research without having ANY experience. 2.2 Edinburgh Scientific Researchers Association (ESRA) About ESRA is a society just like any other but with a special aim to promote independent undergraduate research projects - this is cool. Essentially, here you can come up with a small research project on your own (or in pairs or groups) and lead it from conception to final write up and presentation. ESRA has different ‘departments’ - one of which is the Social Sciences department, which serves as a platform ( a place to meet) for you to brainstorm and develop your experiment with other students interested in social sciences (this is usually Psychology, Linguistics or Philosophy students) The head of the Social Sciences department will help you finalise your idea. Then you can write your proposal (which will get approved by ESRA), submit an ethics form, and then you can go on and collect your data (or do secondary data analysis / or even a lit review) and finally make a poster at the end, which you can present at the ESRA conference at the end of the academic year. All these skills above are exactly the skills you need to develop to be a great researcher - and this is a good place to start. There is no pressure, even no need to actually finish the project. You are the boss of your research. Also also, ESRA will even give you funding to conduct your research, which is great! The skills you develop in ESRA, and the fact that you even participate in a small conference, you can put on your CV or talk about when you are applying for actual research placements or Volunteer Research Assistant (VRA) positions. PsyCRA members corroborate (this is what got us some of the cool opportunities that are further along this document) What you need to do Join ESRA at the start of the semester Go to the Social Sciences department meetings - they usually happen every week Where to find more info ESRA EUSA page ESRA Instagram 2.3 Volunteer Research Assistant (VRA) programme (Rare in pre-honours) About You might get an email from the psychology department about this. The purpose of this programme is to offer undergraduate Psychology students the opportunity to acquire additional research experience in the field, working with an established researcher (somebody in the department). This is a great opportunity to get to know the research that is going on in the department, and also to get to know the researchers here. It’s hard to predict what exactly you will be doing, as it varies depending on what research projects are being conducted. But in general, I would recommend just going with whatever you are assigned to and making the most of it, because you will never know what area might interest you! Priority is given to 3rd and 4th years for this, so it’s best not to have your expectations too high, but there are first or second years that did do this! What you need to do Fill out a survey that the department will send out. There, you will have to tell them some of your grades (it’s advantageous if your grades are good), write a short statement as to why you want to be a volunteer research assistant, and indicate which areas interest you (there is no guarantee you will get something you are specifically interested in, but that’s okay, just go with what you get). You will help with whatever needs to be done for the research project, usually lasting a semester (but you can also agree with your supervisor to continue for longer if it interests you and there is more work to do) Where to find more info The department sends an email :) 2.4 Student-led, Individually-created Courses (SLICC) I don’t known a tonne about this, but I do know they have a website which you can check out and find out more! Here: SLICC 2.5 Emailing It’s okay to email a lecturer and ask if you can help with their research in any way, or ask for advice This is very much a “right place, right time” thing, they might not have any work suitable for you but it never hurts to ask and they will remember your interest! Do not ask post-docs or PhDs directly, you need to go through the lecturer/researcher heading the research they are working on You can also talk to your cohort lead and the career service - set up a meeting! 2.6 Skills development You can also work on your skills independently - best skills to develop would be R programming, working with Excel, Qualtrics, or learning a new programming language (like Python or Matlab) In general, it doesn’t hurt to have good marks at uni :) sometimes when you are applying for positions, they look at your transcript, so it’s good to have a strong one!

You are packed with skill. Here are the research opportunities that you can apply for. Don’t be afraid to go for them even if they look like a long shot at first sight. 3.1 Carnegie Trust Vacation Scholarship This scheme is for undergraduate students in their penultimate year (so third-years here). The way it works is you make a research project, find a supervisor, write a proposal and submit an application. If accepted, you get a scholarship which includes a weekly stipend which will be the equivalent of the current Scottish Living Wage rate (£12.60 per hour in 2025), and you do your research over the summer! The bursary is usually for up to 12 weeks. The deadline for this year is on the 14th of February, 2025! For more information, follow this link. Ask Sinéad for experience! 3.2 Experimental Psychology Society (EPS) Undergraduate Bursary This is a psychology specific bursary - it supports undergraduates studying psychology or a related discipline in the summer vacation immediately prior to their final year (so third-years again!). The way it works is you make a research project, find a supervisor, write a proposal together with the supervisor (and then the supervisor submits this application). If accepted, you get up to 10 weeks’ support (a £375 per week stipend) for your research project. Note: the supervisor must be a member of the Experimental Psychology Society. The deadline for this year is on the 1st of March, 2025! For more information, follow this link. Ask Jana (me) for experience! 3.3 BPS Undegraduate Research Assistantship Scheme Very similar to EPS - you outline a project, apply with your supervisor, and you have to be a third-year. The award provides a student stipend at a weekly rate of £270, for 6 or 8 weeks. Your supervisor must have a BPS membership. The deadline for this year is on the 9th of March, 2025! For more information, follow this link. Ask Jana or Sinéad for application experience (we got the award but didn’t take it). 3.4 MRC Cognition and Brain Sciences Unit (CBU) Placement Scheme at Cambridge This is a 6-week placement at the CBU at the University of Cambridge for third-years! It slays really hard. Essentially, they advertise projects at around March time, you put together an application (no need to write a proposal) where you indicate your motivations, interests, past research experience, widening participation info, and rank your preferred projects. If they like your application, you are invited for an interview. If successful, you get to spend time in a Cambridge college, and go to the CBU every day to help with a research project under a supervisor (which could be a post-doc or a PhD student). You get roughly £2400 for the whole placement (this is just an estimate based on what it was in 2023/24), but you have to pay for your accommodation at the Cambridge college (which could be around ~£1000 for the 6 weeks, but you will still have some money left). They will facilitate the accommodation for you. The deadline for this year is around March or April time, keep a look out, it’s not advertised super early. For more information, follow this link. Ask Jana for experience! 3.5 Medical Research Scotland Undergraduate Vacation Scholarship This scholarship supports undergraduate students that want to do research relevant to human health or disease. This is for 2nd or 3rd year students. You need to contact a supervisor again, develop the project and application together, but the application must be submitted by the supervisor. For projects lasting six weeks, each with a student stipend paid at £420 per week. The deadline for this year is 12 noon, 6th of February, 2025. For more information, follow this link. Ask Mik for experience! 3.6 NIHR Undergraduate Student Internship Programme This placement encourages students to consider a career in academic primary care by gaining hands-on experience in primary care research. You will join an established research team and gain skills in primary care focused research. I do not know much about this placement but I do know that there is a website that you can check out here. Also, this website is also worth checking out for a general overview of mental health research - link The deadline for this year is 1pm 25th March, 2025. 3.7 Our Minds Programme Edinburgh Neuroscience funds up to eight 2-month-long projects exploring some aspect of our thinking, past, present or future - this could be a research project or an outreach project or even and artsy project. This is more of a diverse/flexible programme which doesn’t necessarily have to be research. From the website to get an idea of what they are looking for: “The project should be relevant to questions concerning our minds, such as how it works, why we think the way we do, what we think about, and the outcomes this thinking leads to. For example, you might be interested in creating artwork that explores and questions ideas about the mind, or in exploring the phrenologist’s collection in the Anatomical Museum, you could work in a laboratory studying how the brain works or how it can go wrong, or you might want to tell stories about historical or contemporary issues/challenges related to the mind.” You still need to approach a supervisor before you propose the project. You will need to propose how you will engage the public with the outcome of your project. You will get a taxable two-month scholarship of £3,500 in total and a contribution of up to £500 for additional expenses. The deadline hasn’t been set yet for this year, but from previous years you should expect it to be around April time. For more information, although they still need to update it, look here. Ask Jana for experience. 3.8 New: Science and Policy internship scheme at the MRC CBU This is a new internship scheme from 2025 which aims to recruit an undergraduate intern in collaboration with the UK Government Department for Science, Innovation and Technology to tackle questions relating to mental health, developmental trajectories and social media usage. This internship is a paid opportunity, with the student receiving ~£2,030/month. The internship will span from 16th of June 2025 to the 5th of September 2025 in-person, and we will support applicants in finding suitable accommodation in Cambridge for that period. The application deadline is the 14th of February. For more information, visit this link. 3.9 Rank Prize Undergrad Vacation Grant This one is quite niche - it is for students that are interested in vision/visual perception. Again, you have to be in your third year. The supervisor has to apply for this (and they have to be doing research in vision - Jasna? Ed?) The value of the grant is £460 per week per student together with up to £500 in total for consumables. The grant covers up to 8 weeks. The deadline has not been set yet, but last year it was 18th of March. For more information, visit this link. Ask Jana for application experience (I didn’t end up taking it but got it offered). 3.10 Bradshaw-Eagle Undergraduate Research Scholarship This is more vision research, if you are into that sort of us. The scheme is to support undergraduates who wish to carry out supervised summer research projects during the middle years of their degree in a vision laboratory The Scholarship will provide a stipend (£200 per week, for up to 8 weeks). The supervisor has to apply for this and they have to be a member of the Applied Vision Association. The deadline is 5pm, 14th March, 2025. For more information, visit this link. Ask Jana for application experience (again, I didn’t end up taking it but got it offered).
